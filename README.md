# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
is the systematic application of engineering principles and methods to development and maintenance of deployment. Technology in industry enables creation of software application

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Mastering complexity - development of programming languages
2. Mastering process
3. Mastering machine

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - gathering and documenting user needs
Design - creating detailed designs of software architechure
Testing - looking if system performs its processes as required
deployment - releasing the system
Maintenance - providing ongoing support and updates 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is the approach with distinct phases while Agile is the approach focused on flexibility

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software developer - is responsible for writing codes
2. Quality assurance engineer - ensures software quality
3. Project manager - oversees the planning execution and delivers software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs- theyprovide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging codes
VCS- they track changes to source code and coordinate work

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing requirements
2. Tight deadlines
3. Technical debt
   STRATEGIES TO OVERCOME CHALLENGES
   1. Effective communication
   2. Agile methodologies
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing - testig individualcomponents
2. Integration testing - testing interaction btwn different componenents
3. System - testing entire software system
4. Acceptance testing - testing software to ensue it meets user needs
   IMPORTANCE IN SOFTWARE QUALITY ASSUARANCE
   1. Automated testing

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering - this is making the entered tasks and commands clear for AI to understand. The AI provides good skills 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
